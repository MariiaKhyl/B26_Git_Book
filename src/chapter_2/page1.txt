 Environments
 ==============================================

- environment means where we develop, test and use the application
- companies usually have at least 3 or 4 environments

=> dev env
 - it is for developers to code the app

=> test env (qa)
- some companies might have multiple test envs

=> staging
- it is the same with production, but with mock data

=> prod env
- end users use the product.
